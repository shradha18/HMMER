# HMMER VARIANTS

1. phmmer - single protein sequence against protein sequence database

2.hmmscan-single protein sequence against profile HMM library (Pfam, CATH-gene3DS, PIRSF, SUPERFAMILY, TIGRFAH)

3.hmmsearch-either multiple sequence alignment or profile HMM against protein sequence database

4.jackhmmer-iterative searches. initiated with a single sequence a profile HMM or multiple sequence alignment against a atarget sequence database
